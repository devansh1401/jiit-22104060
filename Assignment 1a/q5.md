# RabbitSign 2.1 Documentation

## Project Overview
RabbitSign is a free implementation of algorithms used to digitally sign software for various Texas Instruments calculators, including TI-73, TI-83 Plus, TI-84 Plus, TI-89, TI-92 Plus, and Voyage 200.

## Key Features
1. Handles various input file formats (GraphLink, hex, binary)
2. Faster than official TI application signing programs
3. No arbitrary limitations on file names or contents
4. Ability to re-sign previously signed applications
5. Free software, runs on any modern system with an ANSI C compiler

## Installation
1. Optional but recommended: Install GNU MP library
2. Run the following commands:

./configure
make
make check
sudo make install

## Usage
Basic usage: `rabbitsign -g myapp.hex`
With specific key file: `rabbitsign -g -k foo.key myapp.hex`

## Main Functions

1. `main()`
- Purpose: Entry point of the program
- Input: Command-line arguments
- Return: Exit status
- Description: Parses command-line options, reads input file, performs signing operation, and writes output

2. `sign_app()`
- Purpose: Sign an application
- Input: Application data, key information
- Return: Signed application data
- Description: Calculates signature and appends it to the application data

3. `validate_app()`
- Purpose: Validate a signed application
- Input: Signed application data, public key
- Return: Validation status
- Description: Verifies the signature of an application

4. `read_key_file()`
- Purpose: Read a key file
- Input: File path
- Return: Key data structure
- Description: Parses a key file and returns the key information

5. `write_output()`
- Purpose: Write signed application to output file
- Input: Signed application data, output file path
- Return: Success/failure status
- Description: Writes the signed application to the specified output file

## Additional Notes
- The project uses high-precision integer arithmetic, which can be accelerated using the GNU MP library.
- It includes the signing key for "shareware" TI-83/84 Plus apps (0104.key).
- An unofficial signing key (05.key) for TI-83/84 Plus operating systems is also included.
- The project is open-source and welcomes community contributions.

## Caution
When using RabbitSign with TI-89 or TI-92 Plus calculators (if a valid signing key is acquired), be cautious as installing buggy Flash apps can potentially break the system. Always test apps in an emulator before installing on a real calculator.
